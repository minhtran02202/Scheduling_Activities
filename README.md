# Scheduling_Activities

This program is my initial step into Object Oriented Programming.
In here, the user can start booking schedules for these activities: pool, movie, and bowling.

For each activities, there is different data structure that manages it. 
Circular Linked List for Pool, Array of Linked List for movie, and Vertex for Bowling.

If you look at the prog1.cpp file, you will see that I made three different versions of the code
each for one activities. This is before I learned about dynamic casting. You can see my usage of 
dynamic casting in the Market Trading Game project.

Overall, this project was very challenging for me having to incoporate the new concep of OOP and
having to deal with three data structures. I felt really rewarded after completing it.
